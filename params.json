If you define no filters, every fast query will get logged.\r\n\r\n    <configuration xmlns:patch=\"http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/\" >\r\n      <sitecore>\r\n\t    <dataProviders>\r\n\t      <main  type=\"Loquacious.DataProvider.LoquaciousDataProvider, Loquacious.DataProvider\" patch:instead=\"main\">\r\n\t\t    <param connectionStringName=\"$(1)\" />\r\n\t\t    <Name>$(1)</Name>\r\n\t\t    <!--\r\n\t\t    <filters hint=\"list\">\r\n\t\t      <filter>{E248FD78-B482-49FD-9151-F0A926448576}</filter>\r\n\t\t    </filters>\r\n\t\t    -->\r\n\t      </main>\r\n\t    </dataProviders>\r\n      </sitecore>\r\n    </configuration>\r\n\r\n## Download ##\r\n\r\nYou can either clone the repository from GitHub or download the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Loquacious.DataProvider/) from the NuGet Gallery.\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\n### Nuget ###\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install the data provider is by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Loquacious.DataProvider/). As it is not a Sitecore NuGet package, you don't need a Sitecore Rocks connection. There is no additional configuration. After installing the Nuget package you're all set.\r\n\r\n### Manual installation ###\r\n\r\nYou can manually install the data provider by copying the Loqacious.DataProvider.dll to you bin folder and adding the config-file to your include folder.\r\n\r\n## Version ##\r\n\r\nThe loquacious data provider has been developed with Visual Studio 2013 and Sitecore 6.6. The nuget package contains a version for .NET 4 compiled against Sitecore 6.6 and a version for .NET 4.5 compiled against Sitecore 7. You should be able to work with other versions as well. If you have some problems with any versions, please let me know by [adding an issue](https://github.com/studert/Loquacious/issues).\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nSee the LICENSE file for license rights and limitations (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2).\r\n\r\n## Credits ##\r\n\r\nCredits go to any decompiler in the world.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
